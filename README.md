# Giving a Lightning Talk
Kimberly Collins

When I decided to give this talk, I had a hard time coming up with a topic
* I’ve given [several lightning talks](https://www.youtube.com/@Techlahoma/search?query=Kimberly%20Collins)
* I’ve helped lots of people find talk topics and give their first talks

Filling 5 minutes is easier than you think

Keeping it to 5 minutes is not as easy as you think

Focus on the beginning and ending of your talk - your first and last slides

Title slide - your topic and your name

# Intro/Vanity Slide
* Give context on who you are and why we’re listening to you
* Subtly mention if you're looking for work

# Call Me Kimberly
* C#.NET software engineer
* SQL Server database consultant
* 17 years of development experience
* Part-time availability for freelance work

Last slides - call to action

* What do you want people to do after your talk?
* Fill in the content of your talk with what they need to get to that point

Finding a topic is the hardest part for everyone

The hardest part is over before you give the talk

Engage with the community
* Participate in Slack discussions - ask and answer questions
* Attend local user group meetups - chat with other attendees

Focus more on Why than How
* You don't have to get into technical details
* Attendees can learn more about the topic on their own if they're interested

![Why You Should Give a Lightning Talk](/why-you-should-give-a-lightning-talk.png)

Share something new or new to you
* Assume the audience knows a little less than they probably do
* It’s fine if you talk about something they already know (devs love that)

* Other people will be giving lightning talks
* It’s fine if yours only applies to some of the audience

Tell a story - your story
* How you got into tech, your role, or your tech stack
* Nobody can “well actually” you

Talk to the leaders of your favorite user groups
* They probably need speakers - ask them to talk through some topic ideas with you
* Tell them you're interested in giving a lightning talk, being on a panel, or just reading the announcements
* Volunteer to help out with meetups to get a feel for how they work

Still think there’s nothing you can speak on?
* Let’s chat about it
