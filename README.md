# Giving a Lightning Talk
Kimberly Collins

* Finding a topic is the hardest part for everyone
* The hardest part is over before you start

Filling 5 minutes is not as hard as you think

Keeping it to 5 minutes is not as easy as you think

Work on the beginning and ending of your talk - your first and last slides

Title slide - your topic and your name

# Vanity Slide
* Give context on who you are and why we’re listening to you
* Humblebrag about your skills
* Subtly mention if you're looking for work

# Call Me Kimberly
* C#.NET software engineer
* SQL Server database consultant
* 17 years of software development experience
* Part-time availability for freelance work

Last slides - call to action

Finding a topic

Identify topics of interest
* Participate in Slack discussions
* Attend local user group meetups

Focus more on why than how
* A 5-minute talk is not the time to get into technical details
* Audience can learn more about the topic on their own

Share something new or new to you
* Assume the audience knows a little less than they probably do
* It’s fine if you talk about something they already know

Other people will be giving lightning talks
* It’s fine if yours only applies to some of the audience

Tell a story - your story
* How you got into tech/your role/your company/your tech stack
* Nobody can “well actually” you

Still think there’s nothing you can speak on?
* Let’s chat about it
* Find my calendly link

Preparing to give the talk

Talk to the leaders of your favorite user groups
* Ask them to help you talk through some topic ideas
* Let them know you're interested in giving a lightning talk, being on a panel, or just reading the announcements
* Volunteer to help out with meetups to get a feel for how they work

Do a practice run
* Hit me up
* Find my calendly link

Thanks! 
* Questions? 
* Ask in Slack!
